<h1>Big Data Using SQL and Tall Array</h1>

@copyright@Kevin Chng

<h2>Overview :</h2>
This script demonstrates how to access your big data in Microsoft Access and process them using databaseDatastore and tall array in MATLAB. After processing, the result will be saved back to Microsoft Access.

<h2>Highlight/Take Away :</h2> 
MATLAB allows to exchange data with relational and nonrelational database.
Automatically coverting between database and MATLAB data type
Support ODBC-Compliant, JDBC-Compliant Relational datase, NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB, and Neo4j)
Database App is available help you to explore the data without writting code, and then generate MATLAB code for automating or operationalizing database workflow.
For large data workflow, you can split SQL queries and parallelize access to data (With Parallel Computin Toolbox/MATLAB Parallel Server)
